![About me]({{ '/images/about.jpg' }}){: .align-center}

The name is **Sarvagya Sagar**. He is a steadfast seeker of knowledge, an occasional purveyor of wisdom, and also coincidentally a hacker. He enjoys never being satisfied with his programming, traveling, mathematics, hacking and occasionally sketching with a touch of mellow smoothness. Stab a fork into your eyeballs and look at his [Twitter Handler](https://twitter.com/iamsarvagyaa) to take a closer look at his work-history. 

**This is enough of talking about myself in the third person.**

Words can’t define me, but I can tell you who I am. Most of my friends called me Mitthu, and I am 23 Years Old, self-proclaimed Infosec badass and self-taught hacker. I invest most of my time in learning DevSecOps, Smart Contracts Development and Security. I do hacking because I love it. I am constantly learning web 2.0 and web 3.0 technologies, penetration testing, and other programming related topics. I love to play with Python, Golang and some low-level languages which turns me in the beast. I am good at building different-different skills and very keen on DevSecOps, Platform, and Web3.0. I like making new connections. I embrace the nerds, and I’m an aficionado of Samy Kamkar & Elon Musk. Hopefully, we cross paths in the real world someday, and we can make it a better place together. Happy to help. **Now it's your time, Tell me your secrets**
